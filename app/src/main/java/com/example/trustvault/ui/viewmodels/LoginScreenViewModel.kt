/**
 * ViewModel class for managing the state of the Login screen.
 *
 * This ViewModel stores the username and password entered by the user, as well as a computed property
 * that determines whether the login form is valid (i.e., both the username and password are non-blank).
 *
 * The state variables are `username` and `password`, both of which are mutable and are observed by the composables.
 * The `isFormValid` property checks whether the form can be submitted (i.e., the user has entered both a username and a password).
